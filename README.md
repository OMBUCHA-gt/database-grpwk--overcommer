Bookstore Database Design & Programming with SQL

Overview
This project simulates a real-world scenario in which you're tasked with designing and implementing a relational MySQL database for a bookstore. The system supports data on books, authors, customers, orders, shipping, and user role management. It demonstrates good practices in schema design, relationship modeling, and access control.


Tools & Technologies
- MySQL 8+ — Database engine

- MySQL Workbench — For writing and testing SQL scripts

- Draw.io (optional) — For visualizing entity relationships


Key Features
- Fully normalized relational schema

- Foreign keys and referential integrity across 15+ tables

- Support for many-to-many relationships (e.g. books & authors)

- Role-based user access management

- Secure user privilege setup (admin, staff, analyst)

- Future-ready structure for order history and shipping workflows


Learning Outcomes
- Design a normalized schema for real-world business logic

- Understand SQL constraints: FOREIGN KEY, UNIQUE, AUTO_INCREMENT

- Manage access using CREATE USER, GRANT, and REVOKE

- Handle many-to-many and one-to-many relationships cleanly
